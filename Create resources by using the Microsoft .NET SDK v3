Create Azure Cosmos DB Resources using the Azure Portal
Objective:
Create Azure Cosmos DB resources by using the Azure portal, including creating an Azure Cosmos DB account, adding a database and a container, adding data to the database, and cleaning up resources.

Why does this matter?
Provides hands-on experience with Azure Cosmos DB.

Demonstrates the process of creating and managing database resources using the Azure portal.

Helps understand the capabilities and benefits of Azure Cosmos DB for scalable, high-performance applications.

Showcases the use of serverless database architecture.

Use Cases:
Storing and managing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data.

Building applications that require high availability and low latency across multiple geographic regions.

Handling diverse data types and querying needs without schema restrictions.

Learning the process of deploying and managing Azure Cosmos DB resources.

Steps to Completion:
1. Create an Azure Cosmos DB Account
Sign in to the Azure portal.

From the Azure portal navigation pane, select + Create a resource.

Search for Azure Cosmos DB, then select Create/Azure Cosmos DB to get started.

On the Which API best suits your workload? page, select Create in the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL box.

Enter the basic settings for the new Azure Cosmos DB account:

Subscription: Select the subscription you want to use.

Resource Group: Select Create new, then enter az204-cosmos-rg.

Account Name: Enter a unique name to identify your Azure Cosmos account. The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character. It must be between 3-31 characters in length.

Availability Zones: Select Disable.

Location: Use the location closest to your users for the fastest access to the data.

Capacity mode: Select Serverless.

Select Review + create.

Review the account settings, and then select Create. Wait for the portal page to display Your deployment is complete.

Select Go to resource to go to the Azure Cosmos DB account page.

2. Add a Database and a Container
Select Data Explorer from the left navigation on your Azure Cosmos DB account page, and then select New Container.

In the New container pane, enter the settings for the new container:

Database ID: Select Create new, and enter ToDoList.

Container ID: Enter Items.

Partition key: Enter /category.

Select OK. The Data Explorer displays the new database and the container that you created.

3. Add Data to Your Database
In Data Explorer, expand the ToDoList database, and expand the Items container. Next, select Items, and then select New Item.

Add the following structure to the item on the right side of the Items pane:

json
{
    "id": "1",
    "category": "personal",
    "name": "groceries",
    "description": "Pick up apples and strawberries.",
    "isComplete": false
}
Select Save.

Select New Item again, and create and save another item with a unique id and any other properties and values you want. Your items can have any structure, because Azure Cosmos DB doesn't impose any schema on your data.

4. Clean Up Resources
Select Overview from the left navigation on your Azure Cosmos DB account page.

Select the az204-cosmos-rg resource group link in the Essentials group.

Select Delete resource group and follow the directions to delete the resource group and all the resources it contains.

Result:
Azure Cosmos DB account, database, and container are created.

Data is added to the new database using Data Explorer.

Resources are cleaned up after the project is completed.

The project demonstrates the use of Azure Cosmos DB for managing distributed data.

Notes:
Ensure your Azure account is active and has the necessary permissions.

Follow each step carefully to avoid any errors.

Use the provided JSON structure as a template for adding more data to the database.
